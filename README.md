## Welcome to the Global Gamers Club Website. 
------
**About the Website**
This website is based on the of the Love Running Website example design provided to us students by the Code Instititue.
I have used the Code Institute student template for Gitpod.

The Global Gamers Club is a fictional club for all gamers who would like to join it from anywhere in the world.
It is based in Ireland and is based on Irish time or Grenwhich Meantime.

## Features

* Navigation
I have used Nav from the Love Running project. It assists the user to choose which page they would like to navigate.

* Header
The Header was taken from th Love Running project and the Images for the Global Gamers Club was taken from Canva.

## Testing 

------

* Validating:
Validating for the site has been done by the W3C Html Validator and the W3C CSS Valitador.

* Lighthouse Checks:
Lighthouse was also used for validation. 

## Deployment 
------
A Final version has been deployed to Github. Gitpod and Github were used for version control. 

The deployment steps to the branch were followed by the tutorials provided. 

The repository link can be found here:

* Credits 
All credit of the layout concept should go to the code institute team and the Love Running project design. 

* Content 
I came up with the copy myself and based the content on popular games my children play with their friends in other countries.

The code was taken from the love running project as a basic structure. I changed all the copy, pictures and colours to suit the new project.

* Media 
**Images**
All images are taken from Canva. I have a pro account and all images are licencensed. I do think some of the images are too big which slows the page load down. They were all made substantially smaller using paint.net. 

** Notes for users:
To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

python3 -m http.server
