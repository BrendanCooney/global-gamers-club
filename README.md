Thank you to the Code Institute for the opportunity for me to do this course. 

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

python3 -m http.server


**Brendan Cooney Notes**
Welcome to the Global Gamers Club Website. 

All credit of the layout concept should go to the code institute team and the Love Running project design. 

The Global Gamers Club is a fictional club for all gamers who would like to join it from anywhere in the world.
It is based in Ireland and is based on Irish time or Grenwhich Meantime.

**About the Website**
This website is based on the of the Love Running Website example design provided to us students by the Code Instititue.
I have used the Code Institute student template for Gitpod.

All images are taken from Canva. I have a pro account and all images are licencensed. The image on the sign up page comes from a Wikipedia post on gamers. 

Happy coding!
