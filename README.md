## Welcome to the Global Gamers Club Website. 
------
**About the Website**
This website is based on the of the Love Running Website example design provided to us students by the Code Instititue.
I have used the Code Institute student template for Gitpod.

The Global Gamers Club is a fictional club for all gamers who would like to join it from anywhere in the world.
It is based in Ireland and is based on Irish time or Grenwhich Meantime.

## Features

* Navigation
I have used Nav from the Love Running project. It assists the user to choose which page they would like to navigate.

* Header
The Header was taken from th Love Running project and the Images for the Global Gamers Club was taken from Canva.

* The Gallery 
The gallery consists of images of gamers or our imagined members. These were all resized in order for them to load faster.

* The Sign up Form 
The sign up form is simple asking members for their name and email address this would be used to keep members informed of certain events coming up.

## Bugs
I was not sure how to add images or screenshots to my readme file until I found out how onn YouTube. Unfortuantely after making the changes in GitHub I could do no further commits via GitPod all commits since then have been manual.    

* Credits 
All credit of the layout concept should go to the code institute team and the Love Running project design. 

* Content 
I came up with the copy myself and based the content on popular games my children play with their friends in other countries.

The code was taken from the love running project as a basic structure. I changed all the copy, pictures and colours to suit the new project.

* Media 
**Images**
All images are taken from Canva. I have a pro account and all images are licencensed. I do think some of the images are too big which slows the page load down. They were all made substantially smaller using paint.net. 

** Notes for users:
To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

python3 -m http.server
